## Overview

Welcome to Mexico City tourism website project.

Normally, when people think about Mexico, they think about our beautiful beaches, coastal areas and resorts (Cancun, playa del Carmen, Tulum), best known as a honeymoon destination and for its gastronomy tourism. With this website, I would like to feature the spectacular Mexico City and what it has to offer to tourists.

This webpage aims to spotlight Mexico City as a tourist destination by providing insights into its background, its culture, its people and offer the most pertinent information about what to see and how to navigate this vast city.

I hope you enjoy this website and who knows? Maybe you will want to visit this wonderful place too.
