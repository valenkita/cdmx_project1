                <h2 class="cdmx-heading">The heart of the Aztec Country</h2>
                <p class="cdmx-text">The capital of the country, and 5th largest city in the world, is one of the favorite destinations of thousands of tourists and the highlight 
                    for many. International tourism in Mexico has surpassed pre-pandemic levels, after 10.26 million visitors came to the country in the first half of 2022. Due in 
                    part to its complex, colourful past, wealth of culture and its historical importance as the capital of the Aztec, Spanish and Mexican Empires, the city is full 
                    of incredible secrets and is packed with beauty both natural and man-made, providing visitors with thousands of attractions, its streets lined with vibrant culture, 
                    music and delicious food. Mexico City is the 7th richest city in the world, after Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Paris and London. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The city was founded by the Aztecs when they built it in the middle of a lake. It was destroyed by the Spanish, and rebuilt again, in the vision of the Colonial Spanish style. 
                While its greatness is visible not only in its history, (UNESCO declared four places in Mexico City as World Heritage Sites: The Historic Centre, Xochimilco, the UNAM, 
                and the Luis Barrag√°n House),  but also in its size, it is possible to travel around Mexico City by subway, on foot or even by bike see the <a href="getting_around.html" >getting around</a>  page.

                <br>
                <h2 class="cdmx-heading">The city that never sleeps</h2>
                <p class="cdmx-text">The variety in Mexico City (also known as CDMX) is infinite. Its days begin before the sun has even noticed the dawn has broken. Its people have already 
                    started to crowd the streets with their office attire and street stalls, the smell of tamales mingles with the smell of the morning coffee. Although the days may seem 
                    predictable, nothing in this city is routine and surprises are where you least expect them.
                <br>
                <br>
                A city with another city underneath is something that could only happen in capitals like this one, because under what we know today as Mexico City are the remains of what was 
                once the Great Tenochtitlan. Some of them can be seen when visiting the Templo Mayor Archaeological Zone, a few steps from the Metropolitan Cathedral and within the Historic Center.
